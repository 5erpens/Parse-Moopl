## Moopl Parser

**This project is concerned with building an interpreter for the Moopl language.
- Use JavaCC to implement a lexer and parser for a context-free grammar, factoring the grammar where necessary to resolve any look-ahead. issues.
- Add semantics actions to JavaCC specification so that the parser builds an abstract syntax tree for every successfully parsed input.
